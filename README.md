Story tell:
we split in 2 subteams
Team A : Mykola Kravchenko & Nando Crespo, why they? they similar confidence and got the homepage task 

Team B: MaksymSharin and Aizada Nazarova gone for more easiest,
 that was profile
Why? because when in a team there is an offset of confidence about using tools and the need of  "doing stuff right" check
there gonna be a bottleneck for make knowledge sharing and steps walkthrough between the most senior and most junior member.
Long-term that align the junior to mids, and improves the mentoring ability of most seniors ones.

So team A done a pair coding approach for don't have to make disaster about GIT, working on nando branch

team B because of maksym little know-how gone with split and check modular works, with integrations on every check
